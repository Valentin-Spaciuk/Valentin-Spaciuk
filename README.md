# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Valentin Spaciuk
Since I was a kid I have always been interested in how video games are created, so I tried to code a game from scratch in C++ but it didn't go well and I decided to give it up.

In 2019 I got intrigued by programming and started doing web development projects just for fun while studying economics. Then I found problem-solving skills to be so much fun that I kept learning more and more.

At the age of 19, I decided to change my career to work in the IT field and it was the best decision I made, because every day I enjoy solving problems by thinking outside the box.

Currently I'm oriented in web development but I'm interested in everything related to computers and mathematics.
