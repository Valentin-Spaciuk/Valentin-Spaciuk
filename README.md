# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Valentin Spaciuk
Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by how video games are created. My curiosity led me to experiment with coding a game from scratch in C++, which turned out to be a valuable learning experience and sparked my passion for programming.

In 2019, I became deeply intrigued by programming and started working on web development projects for fun while studying economics. I discovered that problem-solving was incredibly enjoyable, motivating me to keep learning and challenging myself.

At the age of 19, I decided to shift my career to the IT field, and it was the best decision I ever made. Every day, I find joy in solving problems by thinking outside the box.

I am currently working on the creation and maintenance of RESTful APIs for banking applications, utilizing the Java Spring Boot framework as part of a bank software architecture team. I have completed my studies in Functional Analysis of Computer Systems and have recently started pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematics to deepen my understanding of analytical and quantitative reasoning.
